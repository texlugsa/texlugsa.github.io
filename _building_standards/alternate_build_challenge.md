title: Alternate Build Challenge
---

The goal is something different that the original model using just the parts in the set.

## Guidelines
* Use only parts from the set. Additional parts not allowed.
* All parts do not have to be used.
* Alternate build does not have to relate to original build.
* If building multiple items they do not have to relate to each other.
