<p><strong>Meeting Information</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, our first meeting after the big TexLUG event. This meeting is going to be at Fuddrucker's, which is located at 8602 Botts between Nacogdoches and Broadway (Thanks! Lee). I'm planning on being there from 2 PM - 4 PM. The phone number in case you get lost is (210) ###-####. We have lots to discuss and enjoy.</p>
<p>To those of you who are new to this whole TexLUG-SA thing and are interested and curious what we do, look at our about page. I would like to make these suggestions on what to bring with you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yourself!</li>
<li>Anything that you like or interests you that is LEGO related.
<ul>
<li>MOC</li>
<li>Fav. Set/Booklet</li>
<li>Idea's</li>
<li>Minifig</li>
<li>Piece(s)</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are a very informal group that is all about just having fun and just enjoying each other's unique perspective of the brick(s). Please do not feel like you have to bring something. Just come and meet other people who share your hobby!</p>
